# Project Planner

This app is made to store the details of the project you're working on and provides the functionality to mark the status and other CRUD features.

This uses JSON Server to spin up a local database to store the data.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### To run the JSON Server

```
npx json-server --watch data/db.json
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
